# Concerning the Molecule-Design-Project
Chemists have moved from designing molecules using traditional methods to predicting them using data science for several reasons. 

First, Traditional methods for molecule design are time-consuming and resource-intensive because they require a lot of trial and error.
Second, this method often rely on rules and prior knowledge, which can limit the diversity of molecules that can be generated. 
Also , The cost of materials, equipment, and personnel required for traditional methods can be prohibitive, especially for small research groups or startups.
Finally, The number of possible molecules that can be generated  is limited by the available resources and the creativity of the chemist.
As a part of MOLMINDS group enrolled in #EspritSchoolOfEngineering , we worked on this Molecule design project . 

Molecule design refers to the use of computational methods and algorithms to design new molecules with desired properties or functions. This involves using machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other data science techniques to analyze and model the relationships between molecular structures and their properties, and to generate new molecules that are predicted to have specific properties.
Molecule design in this context is often used in drug discovery, where researchers use computational models to predict the efficacy, toxicity, and other properties of candidate drug molecules.
